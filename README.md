Subject: Clarification on DO Screen Functionality and ODI Initiation in CE

Hi Uddhav,

The DO screen functionality is not possible in CE, as the CE database does not store records like Domestic Counterparty and Overseas Counterparty.

Do I need to create a separate tab for capturing Section B and Section C details for ODI initiation?

Kindly advise.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
