We noticed that the LoadTemplateData servlet may not be correctly escaping the output as HTML, which could potentially allow HTML content to be injected.
To mitigate this, we suggest implementing HTML escaping for both input and output in the LoadTemplateData servlet. If validation against specific characters or tags (e.g., <script>, <html>) is required, it would also be appropriate to include it in this servlet.
That said, since the LoadTemplateData servlet is not developed by our team, we would kindly recommend that the project team review and consider making the necessary updates.
